  caveats <<~EOS
    SecondBrain shells out to the `2nb` CLI, installed automatically as a
    dependency. `brew upgrade --cask secondbrain` does NOT bump the CLI, so
    after upgrading the app run:

      brew upgrade apresai/tap/twonb

    to keep the two in step. The app warns on its Home screen when the CLI is
    behind.
