  caveats <<~EOS
    SecondBrain bundles its own version-matched `2nb` CLI and uses it for all
    AI/indexing/lint work, so the app always runs a matching CLI. The `2nb`
    formula is still installed as a dependency so you have `2nb` on your PATH
    for the terminal and the Obsidian plugin. `brew upgrade --cask secondbrain`
    does NOT bump that formula, so to refresh the command-line `2nb` run:

      brew upgrade apresai/tap/twonb
